# Neural Network from scratch

The aim of this notebook is implement a neural network from scratch in order to classify two diferent sintetic data-sets. 
For one side we have a half moon that is more easy to classify. In the other side we have a spiral data-set that is harder to classify with a NN.
Notice that is used the library `autograd` in order to do the autodiferentation.
